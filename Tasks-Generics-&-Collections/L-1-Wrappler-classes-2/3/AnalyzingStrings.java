/**
 * Implement the countDigits(String), countLetters(String), 
 * and countSpaces(String) methods, which should return the number of digits, 
 * letters, and spaces, respectively, in a string.
 * 
 * The main() method is not involved in testing.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	The countDigits(String) method should return the number of digits in the passed string.
 * •	The countLetters(String) method should return the number of letters in the passed string.
 * •	The countSpaces(String) method should return the number of spaces in the passed string.
