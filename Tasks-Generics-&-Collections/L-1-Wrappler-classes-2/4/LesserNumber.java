/**
 * This program compares two numbers. 
 * If the first number is less than the second number, 
 * then the following message is displayed on the console: 
 * The first number is less than the second number.
 * If the first number is greater than or equal to the second number, 
 * then the following message is displayed on the console: 
 * The first number is greater than or equal to the second number.
 * But at the moment the program terminates with an error. 
 * Find out what is wrong and fix the error.
 * 
 * The main() method is not involved in testing.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	If the first number is greater than the second, then the isLess(int, int) method 
 *      should return false.
 * •	If the first number is less than the second, then the isLess(int, int) method 
 *      should return true.
