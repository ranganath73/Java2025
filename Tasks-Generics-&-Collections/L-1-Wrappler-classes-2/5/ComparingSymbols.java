/**
 * The compare(Character, Character) 
 * method takes two characters and displays the result of comparing them.
 * Implement the compare(Character, Character) method, which should compare the characters correctly.
 * If the code of the first character is greater than that of the second, print "greater than".
 * If the code of the first character is less than that of the second, print "less than".
 * If the code of the first character is equal to that of the second, print "equal".
 *
 * Requirements:
 * â€¢	Fix the compare(Character, Character) method by changing one condition.
