/**
 * ArrayList is a list that stores a dynamically expanding array of elements. 
 * We will now implement our own version of a list that stores strings. 
 * The CustomStringArrayList class has three fields:
 * 
 * String[] elements is an array for storing elements (ArrayList stores values in a similar array). 
 * Initially, its size is 10 (capacity = 10).
 * 
 * int size stores the number of elements currently stored in the list. Its initial value is 0.
 * int capacity is the current capacity of the elements array. It increases as data is added.
 * 
 * To simplify the implementation, we will have only two methods:
 * 
 * A public add(String) method that adds an element to the array. 
 * This method will help us track when the array needs to dynamically expand.
 * When the array is full (size == capacity), the grow() method is called to expand the array.
 * A private grow() method that sets the elements field equal to a new array with a 
 * capacity (capacity) that is one and a half times larger than that of the 
 * old array and copies the data from the old array to the new one in the same order. 
 * The capacity field should increase along with the size of the array.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * •	The CustomStringArrayList class should have private non-static int size, int capacity, 
 *      and String[] elements fields.
 * •	The CustomStringArrayList class should have a no-argument constructor that initializes 
 *      the size field to 0, the capacity field to 10, and the elements field to a new array 
 *      whose size is determined by the capacity variable.
 * •	The CustomStringArrayList class should have a public void add(String) method.
 * •	The CustomStringArrayList class should have a private void grow() method.
 * •	The grow() method must work in accordance with the task conditions.
 * •	Do not change the add(String) method.
