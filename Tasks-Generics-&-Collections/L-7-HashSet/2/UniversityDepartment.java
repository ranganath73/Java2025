/**
 * The UniversityDepartment class has a printStudentNames(ArrayList) method, 
 * which takes a list of objects and displays their names. 
 * But at present the program won't compile.
 * 
 * Your task is to fix this bug. To do this, you need to 
 * correct the signature of the printStudentNames(ArrayList) method so that 
 * it only accepts a list of Student objects (use a generic type).
 * 
 * The main method is not checked.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	Correct the signature of the printStudentNames method so that it only accepts a list of students.
 * •	Do not change the implementation of the printStudentNames method.
