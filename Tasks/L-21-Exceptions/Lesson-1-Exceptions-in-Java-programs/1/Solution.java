/**
 * The program reads a number from the console, 
 * finds the corresponding student in the list, 
 * and calls on him or her to answer.
 * But there is a problem: 
 *          if the list doesn't contain a student with the desired number, 
 *          then the program ends with an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. 
 *          Wrap one line in a try-catch block to keep the program running.
 * 
 * In the catch block, display the message "A student with this number does not exist".
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	One line should be wrapped in a try-catch block.
 * •	The program should continue to work if an invalid number is entered.
 * •	The program should display "A student with this number does not exist" 
 *      every time you enter an invalid number.
