/**
 * The program reads a number from the console, 
 * finds the corresponding student in the list, and calls on him or her to answer.
 * The parseInt and get methods can throw NumberFormatExceptions and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions. 
 * Wrap them with one try block that has two catch blocks.
 * The catch block for NumberFormatException should display "You must enter an integer", 
 * and the catch block for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException should display 
 * "A student with this number does not exist".
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should continue running when a NumberFormatException occurs.
 * •	The program should display "You must enter an integer" every time a NumberFormatException occurs.
 * •	The program should continue running when an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs.
 * •	The program should display the following message: 
 *              "A student with this number does not exist" 
 *              every time an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs.
 * •	The program should have one try block and two catch blocks.
