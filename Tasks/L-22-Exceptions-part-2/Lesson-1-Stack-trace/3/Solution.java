/**
 * In the MyStack class, you need to implement your own version of the stack data structure 
 * based on an ArrayList.
 * All the elements are stored in a private list variable named storage. 
 * Your task is to implement all the declared methods of the MyStack class.
 * Where the push(String) method adds an element to the front of the storage list. 
 * The pop() method returns the first element of the storage list, and then removes it from the list. 
 * The peek() method returns the first element of the storage list.
 * The empty() method checks whether the storage list is empty. 
 * The search(String) method searches for an element in the storage list and returns its index. 
 * If the element is not in the list, it returns -1.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * •	The push(String) method must be implemented in accordance with the task conditions.
 * •	The pop() method must be implemented in accordance with the task conditions.
 * •	The peek() method must be implemented in accordance with the task conditions.
 * •	The empty() method must be implemented in accordance with the task conditions.
 * •	The search(String) method must be implemented in accordance with the task conditions.
