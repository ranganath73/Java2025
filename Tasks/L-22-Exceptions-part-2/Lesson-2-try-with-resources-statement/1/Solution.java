/**
 * The program reads a string from the console and displays it in all lowercase letters.
 * Without changing the functionality of the program, 
 * rewrite the code using a try-with-resources statement.
 *
 * Put the creation of objects that use external resources inside the parentheses. 
 * Remember to remove the unnecessary calls to the close() method.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should read a string from the console and display it in all lowercase letters.
 * •	The program must use the try-with-resources statement as outlined in the task conditions.
 * •	The close() method must not be explicitly called on objects that use external resources.
