/**
 * Write a program that reads the path to file1 and the path to file2 from the console. 
 * Then it writes all the bytes from file1 to file2, but in doing so it swaps them 
 * according to this rule: 
 *          swap the first with the second, the third with the fourth, and so on.
 *
 * If the last byte in file1 is odd, then write it to file2 as is. 
 * To read and write files, use FileInputStream and FileOutputStream.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should read file paths from the console.
 * •	The program must rewrite bytes from one file to another in accordance with the task conditions.
 * •	To read and write files, FileInputStream and FileOutputStream should be used.
 * •	Streams for reading and writing must be closed.
