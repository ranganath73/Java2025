/**
 * Write code that reads a path from the keyboard and display it on the console. 
 * If the path is not absolute, then you need to convert it to an absolute path 
 * before displaying it.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * •	The program should read a file/directory path from the console.
 * •	The program should display this path on the console, 
 *      converting it to absolute if necessary.
 * •	To check a path and convert it to absolute, 
 *      you need to use the isAbsolute() and toAbsolutePath() methods of the Path class.
 * •	Do not use the following classes: File, FileInputStream, 
 *      FileOutputStream, FileReader, FileWriter (of the java.io package).
