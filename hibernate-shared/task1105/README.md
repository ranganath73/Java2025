Write the code for **deleting** an object of type **Animal** with **id = 2** using **HQL**. Use the **createQuery()** and **executeUpdate()** methods.

Do **not** use **other methods** of a **Query object**. Run the program and make sure that there is only one record in the table (**cid = 1**).

**Requirements:** <br>
*	In the main method, the createQuery method must be called on the Session class object, and the executeUpdate method must be called on the resulting Query object.
*	After the program runs, there should be only one entry in the table (with id = 1).
